Company management system


## Project description
Aiming to automate a company management system where the manager supervises 
employees. Employees can receive their salaries and register their attendance. 
Moreover, employees have training. Furthermore, customers can purchase 
products.
Survey on the topic: Modern businesses require efficient systems to manage their 
operations, including customer information, employee records, project tracking, 
and financial data. Current solutions may lack integration or customization 
capabilities for specific organizational needs.
Problem definition: Many companies struggle with fragmented data and 
inefficient manual processes. Our system addresses these issues by offering a 
centralized, automated, and user-friendly platform for managing key business 
activities.
Scope of the system: The Company Management System (CMS) aims to 
streamline organizational operations through modules for client data, employee 
records, scheduling, and communication. It enhances productivity and decision making by providing real-time access to essential information.
Similar systems: ERP systems like Odoo and Zoho offer similar functionalities. 
However, they can be overly complex or expensive for small companies. Our 
system targets simplicity and customization with minimal overhead and tailored 
features.
